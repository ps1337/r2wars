shared memory space trying to catch each other in order to trash

This game was initially developed by pancake as a PoC in here

This repository contains an evolved implementation of the engine

making it impossible to run outside Windows.

The solution was to use an embedded webserver that provides a
web interface using websockets to stream the process changes
from the M

## Dependencies

* Mono / .NET Runtime (always from mono project some distros packages dont work)
* radare2

On windows you need to have radare2.exe and rasm2.exe in the same
